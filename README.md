# KarlotoxinThesis
Code used for the Karlotoxin-prey modeling project

## What are those?
These are the core programs that I coded for my applied math PhD project: Modeling the Karlotoxin's Influence on Prey.
They include all the numerical methods part of the thesis: Monte-Carlo and finite difference methods.
Actually they are much more than what is included in the thesis, since I have tried a range of methods and of course only a subcollection works.
Some simple plotting scripts I did not include, as they are usually very quick to come up with.

## Note
1. For usage, some requires input of data sets from csv docs. The user need to generate them at first of course.
2. Analytical solutions are generated using Mathematica.
3. Adjust the plotting parameters accordingly based on your screen resolution.
4. I use Spyder almost exclusively for scientific Python computations, and I suggest using Spyder to run them as well, since they are divided in cells in Spyder's format.
